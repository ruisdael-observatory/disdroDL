# Agenda Week 7 - TA Meeting

## 03-06-2024

## Chairman: Noky Soekarman
## Minutetaker: Mels Lutgerink

### Discussion points
- Regarding the feedback from the midterm meeting
  - You mentioned that we should spend less time researching, and that this should have happened in the earlier weeks. Although we did do research in those weeks, some things are still not clear when needing to implement them. So how can we find a balance on researching and implementing?
    - 15-20% for research
	  - Should've researched more before implementation
	  - Research is mainly the broad idea, finding implementation techniques is part of implementation

  
  - In the process part you mention: "Be more active, you can find a part of the project which really interests you and explore it". This seems to kind of contradict the previous point, as we are already spending time on exploring/researching. So could you elaborate on this point?
    -This was mentioned by the client, to be more active and find extra things to explore
	  - We mention that we have proposed stuff but they shut that down
	  - This might be communication issue
	  - Figure this out, can have significant impact on grade
    - Client said to TA they expected a bigger refactoring of the original codebase
	  - We say this doesn't resonate with what client communicated with us
	  - Another communication issue
  
  - For the product part you mention: "We expect you to have multiple ways of testing, like unit testing, integration testing (with high coverage) and for really good other ways of testing." What exactly does the latter part mean?
    - For an excellent in the rubric we could implement innovative ways of testing, like user studies
  
- When meeting as a group on campus, we tend to write things down on the whiteboard on what we are going to do during the meeting, should we also upload those notes (in the form of a picture) to gitlab to show more about our process?
  - Yes, just upload a .jpeg's in the docs directorny

- A second point about group meetings, what would be a reasonable amount of time to spend on a meeting? Sometimes we have meetings where we discuss things in quite some detail. Also, this time is not spend on coding, so when you mention we should be working 32 hours, what is and is not included in those hours? Because we feel like those meetings are also important for the project.
  - Time tracking meetings -> 10 hours is too much
	- Last week was an exception because of midterm presentations and feedback processing, e.g. how to proceed for documentation

### Our plan this week

- Quality Control software: Tuesday we have a meeting planned with Marc and Andre to deep dive into what a good and bad netCDF file look like
  - 2x half hour calls follow up
	- Ask client about qc, -> what is the goal, ideal endproduct

- Iron out the bugs in live logging: As previously seen, some bugs take hours, even days to show up. So that's why we still focus on solving those potential bugs this week

- Have csv parsing fully working: CSV parsing turned out to be way harder than expected, that is the reason we still need to work on it in the coming week
