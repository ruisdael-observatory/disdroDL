# Agenda Week 7 - TA Meeting

## 03-06-2024

## Chairman: Noky Soekarman

### Discussion points
- Regarding the feedback from the midterm meeting
  - You mentioned that we should spend less time researching, and that this should have happened in the earlier weeks. Although we did do research in those weeks, some things are still not clear when needing to implement them. So how can we find a balance on researching and implementing?
  
  - In the process part you mention: "Be more active, you can find a part of the project which really interests you and explore it". This seems to kind of contradict the previous point, as we are already spending time on exploring/researching. So could you elaborate on this point?
  
  - For the product part you mention: "We expect you to have multiple ways of testing, like unit testing, integration testing (with high coverage} and for really good other ways of testing." What exactly does the latter part mean?
  
- When meeting as a group on campus, we tend to write things down on the whiteboard on what we are going to do during the meeting, should we also upload those notes (in the form of a picture) to gitlab to show more about our process?

- A second point about group meetings, what would be a reasonable amount of time to spend on a meeting? Sometimes we have meetings where we discuss things in quite some detail. Also, this time is not spend on coding, so when you mention we should be working 32 hours, what is and is not included in those hours? Because we feel like those meetings are also important for the project.
