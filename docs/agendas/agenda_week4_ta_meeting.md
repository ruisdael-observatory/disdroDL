# Agenda Week 4 - TA Meeting

## 13-05-2024

## Chairman: Noky Soekarman
## Minute taker: Ella Milinovic


### Discussion points:
- Feedback on updated requirements
  - Last meeting we gave the updated requirements, we however didn't get feedback on them yet.
- Midterm meeting date, what and how to prepare
  - Now that there is timeframe in which all parties are available, what should be the next steps to prepare for the midterm meeting? 
- Showing progress
  - Since our last meeting we have made progres and we would like to show it. 
- Agenda template
  - Last meeting you pointed out that there is a template for agendas. The only one we found seemed more for meetings within our group, not necessarily with a TA/Coach/Client. Do you expect us to create agenda's using this template for meetings within our group? Or should we also use this template for meetings with you?
- Feedback moment, what can we improve? And what should we keep on doing?
