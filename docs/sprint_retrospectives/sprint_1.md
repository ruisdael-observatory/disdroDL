# Sprint Retrospective

## Group: 007D
## Iteration: 1

## Tasks:

| User Story | Task | Assignee | Time Estimated | Time Spent | Done (Yes/No) | Notes |
|------------|------|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| #26        | #21  | Noky     | --             | 18h        | No            | Getting the right serial connections in the right format and order took more time than expected, and progress was slowed down because of the testing taking more time because of the setup |
| #26        | #25  | Mels     | --             | ??         | No            | There was a .yml file found for the Thies, but that wasn't complete yet. Finishing this had a lower priority than #21, which Mels and Noky looked at together |
| #27        | #24  | Jesse    | --             | 1h         | No            | The framework is mostly set up, just requires a .yml file for the Thies data to make it actually function for exporting that data |
| ---        | #1   | Mels     | --             | ??         | No            | #21 had higher priority, and Mels took ill |
| ---        | #22  | Everyone | --             | 6h         | Yes           | Making the checkstyle pass was divided across everyone |
| ---        | #23  | Ella     | --             | 7h         | Yes           | Research into what tools to use, how to set up an effective pipeline and making it running locally took more time than expected |

## Main Problems Encountered

- Blocked must haves
    - Most of the functionality of other must haves depends on being able to log data from the Thies, which was the biggest issue of the sprint (#21)

- Must haves are hard to split up
    - Since the must haves mainly boil down to two functionalities, it was difficult to split up tasks and have everyone work simultaneously
