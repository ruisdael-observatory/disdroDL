| #57        | #85   | Jesse    | 6h             | 3h         | Yes           | The time estimate was quite high since setting up the boilerplate code for a project was something completely new, but didn't end up taking that long                             |

| ---        | #68   | Noky     | 3h             | 6h         | Yes           | This issue had some problems after more than a day of running, also the integration with parsivel wasn't fully working anymore. That is why there was way more time spent on this |

## Main Problems Encountered

- This week has been quite busy with meeting and presentations. Therefore, we all couldn't spend that much time actually coding.
