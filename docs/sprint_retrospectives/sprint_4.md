| #29        | #77   | Mels?    | 5H             | 7H         | Yes           | TODO: Currently Mels's assigned issue is #29, the user story. Would it make sense to assign #77, parsing old .csv's, to Mels since that's his starting point?                     |
| #29        | #78   | Mels    | 6H             | 8H         | No            |                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| #57        | #85   | Jesse    | 6h             | 3h         | Yes           | The time estimate was quite high since setting up the boilerplate code for a project was something completely new, but didn't end up taking that long                             |
| #57        | #87   | Jesse    | 2h             | 1.5h       | Yes           |                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| ---        | #68   | Noky     | 3h             | 6h         | Yes           | This issue had some problems after more than a day of running, also the integration with parsivel wasn't fully working anymore. That is why there was way more time spent on this |

| ---        | #73   | Noky     | 12h            | 13h        | Yes           | Testing the main loop was a bit difficult since it contains a while True loop                                                                                                     |
| ---        | #80   | Ella     | 1h             | 6h         | yes           | Restructuring thies telegram processing to match the way it is done for parsivel telegrams took longer than expected due to small errors/inconsistencies and merged changes.      |
| ---        | #81   | Ella     | 7h             | 4h         | yes           | After reworking code base for previous testing and getting the hang of pytest fixtures done quicker then expected                                                                 |
| ---        | #83   | Ella     | 7h             | 12h 30min  | yes           | Took longer due to newly implemented pytest fixtures and strong code coupling + some issues wrong implementation within the codebase that the testing discovered                  |

## Main Problems Encountered

- This week has been quite busy with meeting and presentations. Therefore, we all couldn't spend that much time actually coding.
- Parsing old .csv's and .txt's are still difficult, since there is little consistency in naming conventions and the way the data is logged in the respective files.
